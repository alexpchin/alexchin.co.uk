For all those people who have "the next big idea", take a little moment and have a look at [Product Hunt](http://www.producthunt.com/). It's a website that has a nice feed of people's new ideas. This is how it describes itself:

##What's going on here?

Product Hunt surfaces the best new products, every day. It's a place for product-loving enthusiasts to share and geek out about the latest mobile apps, websites, hardware projects, and tech creations.

##What kind of products do you allow on Product Hunt?

Product Hunt is for sharing new, interesting products. It isn't the place for blog posts, news articles, events, or contract services.

A few seconds on Product Hunt will show you just a small selection of the vast number of new ideas that are being created for the internet/mobile every day. With very little thought about curation, here are a few ideas that popped up when I looked at the Product Hunt today:
