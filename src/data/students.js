He delivered successfully part of the curriculum and provided us with support during the labs and projects. I appreciated his availability, his ability to teach effectively complex materials, his commitment to engage students to learn more by themselves and to put in practice the learnings. Alex shown also strong interest in learning new technologies and applying those new skills into his teaching materials. I highly recommend him for a teaching or a web development position.',

Alex is extremely perceptive and has the ability to explain complex ideas in a manner that made his lessons consistently clear and interesting. He is always willing to help, provided insightful feedback when asked and never hesitated to take the time to go through his students' work with them.
