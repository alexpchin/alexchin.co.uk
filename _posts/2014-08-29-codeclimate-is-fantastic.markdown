##What is CodeClimate?
[https://codeclimate.com/](http://)

Recently, I've been working on a code test. I took a little break to go to [LRUG](http://lrug.org/) where someone told me about a code analyser called CodeClimate. It's really easy to use.

Code Climate provides an objective analysis of the quality of your code and gives you the information and tools you need to fix it.
